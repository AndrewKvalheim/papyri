You'll need to install http://jcupitt.github.io/libvips/

to do this on Mac OS X:
    brew install vips

some python stuff you'll need:
    pip3 install requests pyvips

and you'll need minecraftmap; for now use this fork: https://github.com/jason-green-io/minecraftmap

follow the instructions to build and install, I've put in a pull request for the official one to fix 1.12
